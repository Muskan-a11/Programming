# Problem: Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
Logic

Use Euclidean Algorithm:

GCD(a, b) = a if b == 0

Else GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, a % b)

Compute GCD of all elements by iteratively applying the above.

‚è± Time Complexity

Each GCD: O(log(min(a, b)))

For n numbers: O(n ¬∑ log(min(array elements)))

 Space Complexity

Extra variables: O(1)

Recursion stack: O(log(min(a, b)))


 # Problem :flood fill algorithm
 Logic

Use DFS (Depth-First Search) to replace all connected pixels of the starting color with the new color.

Steps:

Check boundary conditions.

If pixel matches the original color, change it to the new color.

Recursively explore in 4 directions (up, down, left, right).

If the original color is the same as the new color ‚Üí do nothing.

‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity

Each cell is visited once ‚Üí O(m √ó n) for an image of size m √ó n.

üíæ Space Complexity

Recursive DFS stack can go as deep as O(m √ó n) in the worst case.

No extra data structures ‚Üí O(1) additional space.

# Problem : deep clone linked list
Logic

Each node has a next and a random pointer.

Optimized cloning steps:

Insert cloned nodes right after each original node.

Set cloned nodes‚Äô random pointers using curr.next.random = curr.random.next.

Separate original and cloned lists.

‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity

Each node processed 3 times ‚Üí O(n)

üíæ Space Complexity

No extra data structures used ‚Üí O(1)

# Problem : EqualSum Partition
Logic

Goal: Check if the array can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sum.

Steps:

Compute total sum. If it‚Äôs odd, partition is impossible.

Target = sum / 2.

Use DP (subset sum): dp[j] = true if subset with sum j can be formed.

Iterate through numbers, update DP array in reverse to avoid reuse.

If dp[target] is true ‚Üí partition possible.

‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity

For n elements and target sum S = sum/2:
O(n √ó S)

üíæ Space Complexity

1D DP array of size S+1:
O(S)

# Problem : Count Unival Subtrees
Logic

A Unival subtree is a subtree where all nodes have the same value.

Approach (DFS, post-order):

Recurse into left and right subtrees.

If either is not unival ‚Üí current subtree is not unival.

If children exist but have different values than the parent ‚Üí not unival.

Otherwise, increment global counter and mark subtree as unival.

‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity

Each node is visited once ‚Üí O(n)

üíæ Space Complexity

Recursion stack in worst case (skewed tree) ‚Üí O(h), where h = tree height.

# Problem : Word Search In 2D matrix
Logic

Goal: Check if a given word exists horizontally (row-wise) or vertically (column-wise) in a 2D matrix.

Steps:

Traverse each row, convert to string, and check if it contains the word.

Traverse each column, build string, and check if it contains the word.

If found in any row/column ‚Üí return true, else false.

‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity

Row check: O(M √ó N)

Column check: O(M √ó N)

Total: O(M √ó N), where M = rows, N = columns.

üíæ Space Complexity

Extra space for temporary row/column strings: O(max(M, N))
